Machine Learning Algorithms  Simulation Prediction Classificarion Regression Statsmodels
Simleng version 0.0 describes the simulation and strategies to develop a preliminary analysis on Classification Task using Statsmodels package.
On this package has been implemented ad-hoc the Genlogistic function given in Scipy package and the K-Fold Cross Validation to estimate the performance of machine learning algorithms. The tests that have developed are included in the sections Simulation-Strategies.

The package contains:

lump-rbf.py -Application with Sample Lumping transformations and Radial Basis Functions Collocation Prediction Method 
metrics_classifier_statsmodels.py --Metrics to evaluate the performance of classification models
simulation_statsmodels.py -- the core of computational program
tools.py -Tools that aid to computation and simulation
LumpedSampleCollocation.mp4 Computational Tools to predict binary classification on three datasets:Pima, Sonar and Ionosphere
